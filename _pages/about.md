Short Bio
======
I am now an Associate Professor at Institute of Automation Chinese Academic of Sciences (CASIA), working with [Prof. Zhen Lei](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/zlei/), IEEE/IAPR Fellow. My research interest includes machine learning and pattern recognition, especially **3D human/face reconstruction and generation**, **human parsing**, and **talking head**. The first author's papers include top journals such as TIP and TMM, as well as top international conferences such as CVPR and ECCV. I won the second place of the Dark Complexion Portrait Segmentation at CVPR 2020 and the third place of the Multi-Person Human Parsing at CVPR 2019. I chaired the National Natural Science Foundation (Youth) and participated in the National Natural Science Foundation (superficial cooperation). The first author's papers include top journals such as TIP and TMM, as well as top international conferences such as CVPR and ECCV.
